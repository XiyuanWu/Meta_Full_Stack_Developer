# Course 4 Project Instructions

For the graded assessment, you need to develop a home page for one of four fictional clients. As you read through the client personas included in this reading, think about what the ideal home page for each of these clients would look like.   

How can you use what you’ve learned over the course? For instance, how will you structure the provided information with semantic HTML tags? You can even start to think about what media elements you could include.   

And how can you create a unique user experience with CSS? Will a grid or basic flexbox serve the client best? What CSS selectors will you use to not only style your page but also create interactivity? And don’t forget about effects! It’s time to have fun and think about how you can apply what you learned about CSS animations.   

The four client personas offer a great variety for you to choose from. They are:  

- Retail: Lucky Shrub  
- Professional services: Hair Day  
- Restaurant: Little Lemon  
- Luxury jewelry: Mangata and Gallo

Read on to find out more about them.


## Restaurant: Little Lemon  
Logo of the fictional client Little Lemon
Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
