# Course 10 Project Instructions

## Scope
You will create a fully functioning API project for the Little Lemon restaurant so that the client application developers can use the APIs to develop web and mobile applications. People with different roles will be able to browse, add and edit menu items, place orders, browse orders, assign delivery crew to orders and finally deliver the orders. 

## Structure 
You will create one single Django app called LittleLemonAPI and implement all API endpoints in it.

## User groups
Create the following two user groups and then create some random users and assign them to these groups from the Django admin panel. 
- Manager
- Delivery crew

Users not assigned to a group will be considered customers.
