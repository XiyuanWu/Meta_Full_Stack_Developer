# Course 2 Project Instructions

In this exercise, you will work with some data provided as an array of objects, listing information about dishes available in the Little Lemon restaurant.

You will need to write a function declaration which will be able to do two things:

If the function is called with the argument `true`, it will output the names of the dishes and calculate their final price (including 20% tax)

If the function is called with the argument `false`, it will output the names of the dishes and give their prices without the additional tax

The expected outcome is that all the dishes' names and prices will be shown in the console output.

The text below shows the output that your code should produce:
```
Prices with 20% tax:
Dish: Italian pasta Price: $ 11.46
Dish: Rice with veggies Price: $ 10.38
Dish: Chicken with potatoes Price: $ 18.66
Dish: Vegetarian Pizza Price: $ 7.74

Prices without tax:
Dish: Italian pasta Price (excl.tax): $ 9.55
Dish: Rice with veggies Price (excl.tax): $ 8.65
Dish: Chicken with potatoes Price (excl.tax): $ 15.55
Dish: Vegetarian Pizza Price (excl.tax): $ 6.45
